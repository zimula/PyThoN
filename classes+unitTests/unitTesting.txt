UNIT TESTING TDD
	- each test is testing a boolean expression
	- a way of testing specific parts of the code
	
AN EXAMPLE USING STUDENT CLASS: 

	- check if the gpa method works. 
	class Student():
		def __init__(self, name, grade, gpa)
			self.name = name
			self.grade = grade
		def getGpa(self):
			if self.grade = "A":
				return 4.0
			else:
				return 1.0

	- testing the method.
		a. import unittest: #python library with test class. 
		
		b. import code to be tested: student class in this case. 
		
		c. setup test. 
			- the test will require 2 unit tests: 
			a. if gpa = 4.0
			b. if gpa = 1.0
		
		d. create test class with unittest methods. 
			
			class TestStudentGpa(unittest.TestCase):	
				- the first scenario
				def test_getGpa_A(self):
					-instantiate student object
					student = Student("Tom", "A")
					- run test
					self.assertEqual(student.getGpa(),4.0)
				
				- the second scenario
				def test_getGpa_B(self):
					-instantiate student object
					student = Student("Jack", "B")
					- run test
					self.assertEqual(student.getGpa(),1.0)
			- make sure test is executed as the main program. 
			if __name__ == '__main__':
				unittest.main()
	- if the method works as intended, the first test will return true and second on too. 

GENERATING TEST REPORTS VIA HTML
	a. pip install html-testRunner
	b. from html_testRunner import HTMLTestrunner
	c. add testRunner to main 
		if __name__ == '__main__':
				unittest.main(testRunner=HTMLTestRunner(output='folder in active directly'))
				- the folder is created if it doesn't exist. 
	- same thing with custom report name
		if__name__=='__main__':
			custom_report_file_name = "custom name.html"
			runner = HTMLTestRunner(output=custom_report_file_name)
			unittest.main(testRunner=runner)


=========================================================================================

TDD: WRITING TESTS BEFORE THE CODE. 
TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: requirements as tests. 
	- under this approach, the tests are written first,
		a. write a failing test
		b. make the test pass
		c. clean up the code
AN EXAMPLE WITH A STOCK ALERT
- an app to read stock updates from some server
- process the informaton
- decision based some criteria
- an alert when decision is reached

a. The test: example in tdd folder. 
	- a stock must have a name
	- for now we will assume the price is none. 
	- the test will check if price = none. 
	
	import unittest
	class StockTest(unittest.TestCase):
		- instance of a stock 
		stock = Stock("GOOG")
		self.assertIsNone(stock.price)
		
	-check if main and generate report. 	
	if__name__=="__main__":
		custom_report_file_name = "custom name.html"
		runner = HTMLTestRunner(output="folder")
		unittest.main(testRunner=runner)
	- after the test fails, a class with is create/ corrected in order to pass the test. 
	class Stock:
		def __init__(self, symbol):
			self.symbol = symbol
			self.price = None
			- self.price has no relation to any parameter or argument in constructor. 
- continuously add tests and improve stock class. 
***************************************nice to know*****************
try-except-failure

try: 
	something
except someError: as a result of try
	return
self.fail("exception not triggered by try")
********************************************************************
REDESIGNING THE TESTS AND CLASS 
- price and datetime will be arrays.
